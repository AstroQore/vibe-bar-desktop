# Settings document v1

This is the cross-client, product-disabled document contract for
`settings.json`. It defines parsing and three-way merge semantics only. The
shared-store manifest remains `json_unversioned` / `legacy_unsafe`, and neither
client may use this document engine as write authority until the native writer,
lease eligibility, durable replace path, and joint interop tests ship together.

## Envelope

The top level is one JSON object, capped at 8 MiB.

- A legacy v0 document contains neither `schemaVersion` nor `revision` and is
  read as revision 0.
- A v1 document contains both `schemaVersion: 1` and an unsigned 64-bit integer
  `revision`.
- A partial envelope, non-object root, floating/negative/overflowing revision,
  or unknown schema fails closed.

All non-envelope values remain raw JSON. Unknown top-level keys and unknown
values nested inside known settings must survive semantically; clients must not
re-encode a partial typed projection as the whole document.

## Three-way patch

For every key the caller changed between `base` and `desired`:

- when `current == base`, apply `desired` (including removal);
- when `current == desired`, the change is already applied and is idempotent;
- otherwise report a structured conflict and apply nothing.

Keys where `desired == base` are untouched, even when another client changed
them in `current`. A successful non-empty patch emits v1 and increments the
current revision exactly once. `schemaVersion` and `revision` are protocol-owned
and cannot be patched. Revision overflow fails closed.

Desktop's first prospective writer whitelist is limited to display/refresh,
menu-bar, core-provider visibility/order, and plan-label preferences. This is a
future product gate, not permission granted by these fixtures.

## Fixtures

- `settings-document-v0-legacy.json` — envelope-free legacy input.
- `settings-document-v1-unknown.json` — v1 plus unknown top-level and nested
  fields that must survive.
- `settings-document-vectors.json` — one non-conflicting merge and one same-key
  conflict shared by Swift and Rust.

These fixtures are a design record: nothing in this repository reads or
validates them today, and the SHA-256 sidecars that once pinned their exact
bytes were removed along with the implementations that checked them. If this
work is picked up again, the native directory becomes the source of truth once
more and both lanes verify the bytes before decoding.
